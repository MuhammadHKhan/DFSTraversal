# DFSTraversal
This program is going to use a DFS traversal to find    all the paths that are "Two ways" in the linked list.   The DFS traversal boolean function will go through all of   the nodes current neigbors to find if a two way path exists,    and if it does, it will push it on to the stack we have created   by using the stack class. We will also be using an iterator to    iterate through the function to find if any two way paths exist,    and if they do, we will print them to the screen.
